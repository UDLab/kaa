## Prerequisites

- You understand the Kaa platform [microservice-based architecture][architecture overview].


## Basic concept

Kaa automation services power the Kaa platform to run various automation types on in-platform events.
Examples of such automation could be sending an email or mobile push notification, ticket creation in [Redmine][redmine], sending a command to a device, and so on once a specific event was fired.  


## Components

The table below summarizes the list of Kaa platform components that contribute to this feature:

| Service                                  | Version         |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| [Action Automation (AA)][AA]             | {{aa_version}}  |
| [Action Automation Connector (AAC)][AAC] | {{aac_version}} |
| [Rule engine (RE)][RE]                   | {{re_version}}  |
