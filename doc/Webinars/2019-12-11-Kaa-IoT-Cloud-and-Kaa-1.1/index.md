In this webinar we introduce the [Kaa IoT platform release 1.1][whats new in 1.1] and the alpha version of the Kaa IoT Cloud.
We look at how to connect and manage your devices with the Kaa Cloud using a climate station application as an example based on Raspberry Pi with SenseAir S8 and BME280 sensors.

For details on how to connect SenseAir S8 and BME280 sensors to Raspberry Pi see "[Raspberry Pi to SenseAir S8 CO2 Sensor via UART](http://co2meters.com/Documentation/AppNotes/AN168-S8-raspberry-pi-uart.pdf)" and "[Using the BME280 I2C Temperature and Pressure Sensor in Python](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2016/07/using-bme280-i2c-temperature-pressure-sensor-in-python)" articles.

The client application Python script for the Raspberry Pi is available [here][code_url].
