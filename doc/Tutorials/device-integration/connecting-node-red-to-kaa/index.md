In this tutorial, we will look at how to send data to the Kaa platform by using Node-RED, which is a flow-based development tool for visual programming.
You will learn how to create a digital twin of your Node-RED device, connect the device to Kaa, submit some telemetry and view it in the Kaa web interface.


## Overview

We will be using [Node-RED][Node-RED] installed on a Raspberry Pi.
However, in your case Node-RED can be installed **anywhere** - on a local machine, on some other device instead of Raspberry Pi, in the cloud, etc.
Our device will represent an [endpoint][endpoint] in the Kaa platform and report temperature, humidity, and air pressure.
Also, we will interact with the Kaa [Web Dashboard][WD] to create a digital twin of the Raspberry Pi and view telemetry data.


## Prerequisites

1. You have a [Kaa Cloud account][Kaa cloud registration].
2. You have a [BME280][BME280] sensor (optional).


## Playbook


### Connect your device

Go to the "Device Management" dashboard in your account.

![Menu device management](attach/img/menu-device-management.png)

Then add a new device specifying a token that we will use later to identify the Raspberry Pi in the Kaa Cloud.

![Add device](attach/img/add-device.png)
 
Also, go to the added device page from the "Device Management" dashboard and copy the application version name. 

![App version device page](attach/img/app-version-device-page.png)

We will need both the application version and the token to connect the Raspberry Pi to the Kaa Cloud.

Now that we have a digital twin of our device created in Kaa together with its token and application version, let's work with the Raspberry Pi.


Connect a BME280 sensor to the Raspberry Pi by referring to the following table:  

|MODULE PCB|DESC   |GPIO HEADER PINS|
|----------|-------|----------------|
|VCC       |3.3V   |P1-01           |
|GND       |Ground |P1-06           |
|SCL       |I2C SCL|P1-05           |
|SDA       |I2C SDA|P1-03           |

Hereâ€™s the diagram the breadboard setup diagram.  
![BME280 module setup](attach/img/bme280-module-setup.png)

If you don't have a BME280 sensor, then skip the above step and move on.

You may use an Ethernet cable or connect the Raspberry Pi to WiFi [using command line](https://raspberrypihq.com/how-to-connect-your-raspberry-pi-to-wifi/) or [graphical desktop user interface](https://maker.pro/raspberry-pi/tutorial/ways-to-connect-raspberry-pi-to-a-wi-fi-network).

Once the Raspberry Pi is connected to the network, install Node-RED:  
> NOTE: Node-RED is pre-installed in the "Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) with desktop and recommended software", so you may skip installation step if you have this OS distribution.
{:.note}

```bash
$ sudo apt install nodejs
$ sudo apt install npm
$ sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red
```

After the installation is complete, start Node-RED:

```bash
$ node-red
```

![Node-RED start](attach/img/node-red-start.png)

When Node-RED reports in a console that it is running, open a browser on the Raspberry Pi and go to `127.0.0.1:1880` or, if you are using the browser on another computer, you will need to use the Raspberry Pi IP address from your network: `your_raspberry_ip_address:1880`.

### Sending data over MQTT

Install a BME280 node, for that click on a menu button in the right top corner and open **Manage palette**:

![Node-RED manage palette](attach/img/node-red-manage-palette.png)

Then, click on **Install** tab and search for **bme280**.

![Node-RED search BME280 node](attach/img/node-red-search-bme280-node.png)

Install `node-red-contrib-bme280` node.

OK, now let's import the Kaa Node-RED client flow description into Node-RED. 

Click **menu** -> **Import**:
 
![Node-RED import](attach/img/node-red-import.png)

If you have BME280, use this flow description:

```json
{% include_relative attach/code/kaa_node-red_flow_bme280.json %}
```

If **not**, use this flow description:

```json
{% include_relative attach/code/kaa_node-red_flow.json %}
```

Copy the corresponding code, then paste it into the red field and click **Import**.

![Node-RED import clipboard](attach/img/node-red-import-clipboard.png)

Open the `Init Global` node and change the token and the app version:

![Configure client](attach/img/configure_client.png)

At this point, the nodes only exist in the editor and must be deployed to the server.
Click **Deploy**.
Node-Red will start executing the flow on the server (Raspberry Pi), pushing collected data from BME280 into the Kaa platform.


### Visualize data from the device


#### Enable time series auto extract

Edit the application configuration for the [Endpoint Time Series service (EPTS)][EPTS].
EPTS is a Kaa platform component responsible for transforming raw [data samples][data-sample] into well-structured time series.
It also stores the time series data and provides access API for other services, including the [Web Dashboard][WD].

![Edit EPTS configuration](attach/img/applications.png)

Enable the [time series auto-extraction][EPTS time series auto extraction] from data samples.

![Enable time series auto extract](attach/img/epts-autoextract-config.png)

With this function enabled, Kaa will automatically create a time series for each numeric field that it encounters at the root of data samples submitted by your endpoints.
You will then be able to view these time series in the Kaa UI, with no extra configuration required.


#### Visualize data

Go to the device details page of the recently created endpoint (by clicking on the corresponding row in the device table on the "Devices" dashboard).
See the data from your Raspberry Pi on the "Device telemetry" widget.

![Device telemetry data](attach/img/device-telemetry-data.png)

Congratulations, you have successfully send data from your Raspberry Pi with Node-RED and visualized it in the Kaa UI!
